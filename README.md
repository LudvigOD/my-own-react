# Making my own version of React 🎯🎯🎯
The purpose of this project was to create my own version of react, which I call Respond (get it?), in order to learn how react really works under the hood and why it is an effective framework for web programming.

## My takeaways 📝
* I learned how the virtual dom actually works and how elements are defined in react.
* I learned how Babel works and how to use Babel CLI
* I refined my ability to use the built in debugger in my browser.
* I made my first framework for web programming ;)

## Problems I faced 🚧
* I hade som import problems
* After I switched from directly setting and getting values, from my global folder, to using get and set functions I forgot to make my variables in the global folder private and that caused some conflicts.
